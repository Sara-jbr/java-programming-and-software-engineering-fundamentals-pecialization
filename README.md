# Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization

This repository is an overview of my practice projects from the [Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming) on Coursera (Duke University).  
Each project is maintained in its own repository, and this repository serves as a collection with links to all projects.
